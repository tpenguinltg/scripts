Scripts
=======
Some personal scripts that I use. Most are not intended to be used as-is; instead, use them as a base to create your own personalized scripts.

All scripts are released under the [https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT](MIT license).

alarm.sh
--------
A wakeup alarm script. It adjusts volume levels and plays a playlist. Pass in `-h` for more details.

backup.sh
---------
My backup script, using [Duplicity](http://www.nongnu.org/duplicity/) as its backend. You will probably want to change the paths defined in the script.

pulsewrap
---------
A utility to start [PulseAudio](https://wiki.freedesktop.org/www/Software/PulseAudio/) specifically for a program (i.e. Skype). [apulse](https://github.com/i-rinat/apulse) is a better solution, but it doesn't seem to play well with my current configuration.
